Transactional Processing Project: Creating a patient care form

Before building the website, we had to make a template to show how we wanted our form to look: <br>

### **Description:**
This project represents a cumulative four-part web development series, where each assignment systematically built upon the previous one to create an increasingly sophisticated and user-friendly form application.

⋆ A1 Foundation: <br>
Established the core structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, implementing a basic functional form with flexible styling and interactivity. <br>

⋆ A2 Validation & Review: <br>
Enhanced the form by introducing user-friendly validation, preventing submission if required fields were left blank. Added secure handling of sensitive data (like SSN) using onblur validation and a review feature, allowing users to double-check their information before submitting. <br>

⋆ A3 Strict Validation & Guided Workflow: <br>
Introduced strict formatting rules (e.g., phone number as xxx-xxx-xxxx) and a validation button to highlight missing or incorrect fields. The submit button was disabled until all inputs passed validation, ensuring data completeness and accuracy. <br>

⋆A4 Enhanced UX & Persistence: <br>
Added a sticky/fixed header for better navigation, integrated external content via iFrames, and implemented storage and cookies to remember user inputs—when the “Remember me” option is selected—creating a seamless, returning-user experience. <br>

### What I learned & how I could've improved <br>
This project was a deep dive into front-end development, where I applied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—from foundational principles to advanced interactivity. I gained a new appreciation for the intricate details that shape user experience, realizing how much complexity lies behind even the simplest web elements. While I’m proud of the final result, I recognize opportunities for refinement, such as improving the visual layout through better-aligned input fields and fine-tuning the sticky footer to ensure it stays within the viewport without overflow.
